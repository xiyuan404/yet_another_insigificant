<p>Today we're going to talk to Will Chase. I'm really excited about this interview! If you want to give a really quick intro to who you are and, maybe how you got into the data viz field, I think that'd be great.</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:00:12]</p>
<p>Yeah, thanks a lot. so I am a data viz designer, a little bit of everything. So I do, essentially, a lot of design, UX, product design, also data visualization development. Currently I work at Fidelity where I do the intersection of a lot of these things. More on the, sort of, product design side of things, but I'm also doing product design on data visualization.
So it incorporates a lot of that. And then I freelance part time doing more creative work, more journalistic focused work. So visual storytelling, web design, data visualization development, and all those related things.
How I got into this field is, probably like most people, pretty unique. I think a lot of people who got into this field came from sort of non-traditional backgrounds, since it's a fairly new field.
So I started out in academia. I was in Biology for a while. I did Plant Biology and Microbiology. Eventually I sort of started transitioning to Computational Biology and that got me into coding. So I started doing more like data analytics, data science kind of stuff. And then I realized through that, that visualization was actually what I really enjoyed.
So then I spent a couple of years doing visualization, sort of, working on my design shops, learning about things like typography and color while I was teaching myself to code. I coded in our first. And then nowadays I do most of my coding was JavaScript. Although I still do all my data analysis and a lot of static visualizations with R.
I just recently have gotten this job. So I've been at Fidelity for about a year and I've been freelancing, to various degrees, for a couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:02:18]</p>
<p>Oh man. So I think you started pretty recently, right? And I feel like I've seen you on Twitter and you're pretty public about your learning process, right? Do you... you have this whole learn in public mantra of trying and posting about it?</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:02:38]</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, there's a couple aspects of it. So I think, for one, it's a great way to promote yourself, right? So a lot of traction I've got, like clients I've gotten, people I've met, opportunities I've gotten have been because I do post a lot of my work publicly. Both posting code and also tutorials and blog posts. Recently I've been streaming some of my work, making videos. and you know, that does bring a lot of attention from all kinds of avenues. And so, you know, on the one hand, it's definitely good. Like if you're learning, you're also building your publicity at the same time. But the other side of it, I guess I would have, that wasn't necessarily my main motivation for doing it. It was more that, I'm completely self-taught and so, when you're self-taught you rely completely on all these materials that people have produced, usually for free.
So, when I was learning, it was all like blog posts or free books that people had made available, video courses, tutorials. And I still learn like that. And so, you know, I did feel sort of like it was a responsibility, not necessarily a requirement, but I felt like I should be giving back, and sort of doing the same thing so that people ould  continue to learn from whatever I produced.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:04:03]</p>
<p>Yeah, I totally agree. I had a very similar, I don't know, reaction where I'm also self-taught and there's so much good stuff online for learning how to code. And that's a lot of the reason why I put posts now is it's kind of like pay it forward. Like a lot of people helped me. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:04:25]</p>
<p>And it wasn't like that. I mean, you know, like this is a fairly recent development, right. I think like only within the past, I dunno, 10 years probably has there become such open access to stuff and enough diversity  and enough quality content that it is... I don't want to say easy to teach yourself, but you know, certainly easier than it used to be.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:04:47]</p>
<p>Yeah, I heard someone on a blog on a podcast recently talking about the difference between teaching yourself and going to a coding boot camp where you can teach yourself because there's so many good resources online, but the hard part is when you have a very specific problem that you can't Google, you kind of just want an answer, which can be really hard. But then like just developing those skills of knowing how to Google for things and how to evolve are so important.</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:05:18]</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:05:20]</p>
<p>You freelance and you also do data viz at Fidelity. How are those two types of projects different?</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:05:31]</p>
<p>They're extremely different. So, my work at Fidelity is, you know, like enjoyable, but it's definitely more of like a pay the bills kind of job. It's not something where I'm able to exercise a ton of creativity, just because, you know, it's a large organization, we have a lot of important stakeholders and, you know, the subject matter is more like in the business world, people are much more interested in like, what's the insight in terms of, you know, like, what's the impact of this visualization? What's the like net result of, you know, how is this going to change the company's bottom line?
And so, it's usually much more about getting across an insight and that usually happens through fairly simple charts presented in a way that's easy to comprehend.
So I basically take all the pent up creativity that I have and exercise that in my freelance job where I don't do any of that kind of stuff. So, in most of my freelancing or personal projects, you know, it's not always paid work a lot of times, these are personal projects as well, I do things where it's much more visual journalism focused, much more like, entirely custom charts, sort of experimental things. Things are a little bit off the wall sometimes. I'm usually trying something new all the time and incorporating new stuff that I've learned, and doing things that either fall pretty squarely within rhe visual journalism side or tend to sort of blur the line between like data art and data visualization.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:07:13]</p>
<p>Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I find that... I used to work on a product at a dashboard company, and a lot of what you're doing is... it's data viz, but it's like bar charts or line charts. So, It's really nice to have projects where you can kind of just go crazy. especially if you're building those skills at work and then you can kind of scratch an itch on the side.
And I always found that any side projects I do on the side, I'd end up using those skills in my day to day work. That's really nice.</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:07:54]</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:07:57]</p>
<p>Let's walk through one of the projects you did recently, if there are any specific ones that you kind of want to talk through. From the brief all the way to the final product.</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:08:11]</p>
<p>Let's see, Do you want me to like share my screen and walk through something?</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:08:18]</p>
<p>Yeah, I think that'd be great if you have anything. Otherwise I can share a link after.</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:08:22]</p>
<p>No, definitely. Let me pull up my most recent project.
So this is, a project that I did sort of actually it's been going on for like a year, because I started collecting the data, back in like October or September of 2019.
But I didn't really begin building this project until the Spring of 2020. So this is a project about retired hurricanes. So I think the story of how this started was that, one night I was like, just randomly got curious about how hurricanes were named, I think, cause we had like a big hurricane season that year.
So I was looking up like how hurricanes get their names, and then took me to a Wikipedia page where I found out, which I sort of knew, but like I found out that, the names are using lists, in alphabetical order. And then they repeat every six years. So there's like six lists and then the list recycles.
For example, this is the list that was used for 2018 and they go through all these names. And then, these are the other lists, but this 2018 lists will repeat again in 2024. When I was on that Wikipedia page, I saw something that was like retired hurricanes and it explains like anytime there's a storm that's like particularly damaging or particularly deadly, that name is often retired, out of respect for the victims. And so in 2018, for example, they retired Florence and Michael, and then those are replaced with a new name. And the next time that list is recycled. And on this Wikipedia page, there was a link to a sub page that was a list of all retired hurricane names. So I went there and it was basically like a giant data dump. Someone had gone through and collected all kinds of data on all these storms, like wind speed and category number of deaths, amount of damage, all that stuff. So I immediately got this idea to sort of, to visualize, the history of all of these retired hurricane names and do a story about this because it's sort of, you know, it's a self-selected list essentially of like all the worst hurricanes in our history.
So I ended up making this story. The primary visual is this circular chart. So, this visualizes each one of the storms going from the 1950s up to 2018, and each of these names is one of the retired, hurricanes.
Let me pull up the legend so I can sort of walk through that first. So each of these sort of arms that's going out from the middle has the destructiveness measured here. So the length of this line is the damage caused by the storm. And then the size of this bubble at the end is the number of deaths.
The inner circle, with these diamonds, is actually showing the previous occurrences of that name. So I mentioned like the lists keep recycling until the name gets retired. So this is the year that like the main got retired, but, you know, before that it might've been used like a few times, you know, maybe only once or twice, and this is filled or unfilled as whether it made landfall.
{Then at the end with these little diamonds around the corner or around the end of the edge circle, it represents the category of the hurricane wherever it hit. So initially I had just planned to do the overall category of the hurricane, just as like a colored dot or something, but then it occurred to me that hurricanes often hit multiple locations and that the peak category of a hurricane might not occur when it actually makes landfall. It might occur like out in the middle of the ocean. And so it's not really an accurate way to represent it. So I went through and recorded in four different locations }
{\cf3  () }
Eastern seaboard, Gulf coast, Caribbean, or Central America) what the peak category was when the storm made landfall in that area, or if it didn't. and so I knew from the beginning that I wanted to make a circular visualization, like a big radial visualization, partially because, the visual metaphor here was, you know, like hurricanes obviously have this shape with a little eye in the center.
And so the idea of a radial visualization kind of mirrors that shape, but the primary challenge was that normally radio visualizations like this work well in print, because you can, you know, like pick it up, bring it closer to yourself and like turn the page to, you know, see all the way around the edge.
And my experience with them on the web was that, most of the times people just kind of punked this issue, right? They're like, okay, it'll just be an SVG and you can like zoom in and pan around if you want. But. It's never really good to read. Like it's always kind of annoying to try to read them. So yeah.
You're tilting your head around or you're like, I hate zooming on things and panning it's always like weird. So, my main goal with this, one of my main goals was to make one that was web native and worked well and was easy to read. So I came up with this idea of zooming in. and then this enlarges all of these, and then you can use your scroll wheel to turn the whole visualization, so that you can sort of mimic that idea of like picking it up and turning it, or you can use your keyboard buttons.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:14:26]</p>
<p>That's great!</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:14:27]</p>
<p>The other thing is that I wanted this to be responsive and work well on any screen size. So, if I resize this, it works well. it also works on mobile. So yeah, that was one of the primary things I wanted to do with this. And then there's a little bit of other material at the end. some more stuff about retired hurricanes.
If you want to read the making of blog post, that is on my blog where I go into more excruciating detail about all the data, all the UX, the visual design, the typography, the colors, everything like that.
I did end up pitching this story to Scientific American and it was published in their August, 2020 issue.
So, this was actually my first piece that appeared in print. That was pretty cool, especially since I always thought it would work best in print, but I think the online version I really enjoy just because of the functionality of the zooming and turning and stuff. I think it's really fun.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:15:37]</p>
<p>Yeah. I love this. And, we'll have the links to both this and the making a blog post, which people can read in excruciating detail.
And I love your zoom-in interaction because it's such a great example of troubleshooting with data viz. I think it's a really cool field where, we're still establishing, you know, how to do things, especially how to do things on the web.
There's so much space for stuff like this. Where it's like, "Hey, what we usually do isn't really working for me. Figure out a way to fix it."</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:16:13</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, exactly. That was my thought.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:16:15]</p>
<p>Are there any other highlights that you want to do for, the process? Was this circular layout your first instinct? Were you like, I know exactly what I'm going to do?</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:16:31]</p>
<p>Yeah, it was... so I do talk about this a little bit in the blog post, but I had... it sort of started even more like a hurricane. So the initial idea, it was always going to be a circular layout. But in the initial layout, I actually had those, you know, all those little arms coming out were curved so that it looked like a vortex.
And I sort of started like, prototyping that I started something on Observable and, you know, basically just tried to curve these little lines and I ended up ditching that because it just looked sort of like a weird creepy spider and stuff instead of like a hurricane. So, visually it just wasn't working that well.
And also, you know, like curved things are definitely harder to read. So I was hoping in my mind that it would look cool enough that it wouldn't matter, but it turned out that it was just harder to read and weird looking. So yeah, and then it evolved a lot. It started out pretty bare bones with just data on the amount of damage and the deaths.
And it was kind of like just that line with a bubble on the end. and then from there I was like... "Okay, this needs like some more stuff." Cause it looks kinda sparse. and so then I got the idea of adding the category information with those little diamonds. and then I realized it's kind of losing the connection to the idea of naming.
And so that was when I added the little inner circle with all the diamonds that has like all the previous uses of that name.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:17:58]</p>
<p>It seems pretty straightforward, as far as the data viz projects go. I feel like I always start with sketching. I don't know if you sketch a lot, but then you can't sketch a lot, because it's data, right. And it's really gonna depend on, like, is it going to look like a spider? I'm not gonna know from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:18:20]</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. I think I did start sketching initially and my sketches always look very childish and bad because I'm not very good at sketching.
But... it was definitely one of those situations where once I got the data in there, it was like, yeah, that doesn't work.
Yes. I do highly recommend that everybody starts with sketching. I still sketch, even if I'm bad at it. And it, even if I know it's going to change when the data hits it, I still think it's definitely worthwhile to like sit down at the beginning and just sketch because, more as like an exploration.
So it helps you to kind of explore without having to worry about like coding it or getting bogged down with a bug. so it's definitely something where you can just experiment with tons of different visual forms really quickly to try to sort of figure out what works best.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:19:15]</p>
<p>Yeah. I love that. I find that if I code something right away, I'm going to do it in the easiest way possible. So it's going to follow whatever is easiest, you know, with SVG or with HTML. And that's not really going to lead to the best result.</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:19:34]</p>
<p>Yeah. And I mean, I definitely take that approach too. And I usually do... I think I mentioned this when I started this one on Observable, I usually do that where if I'm working with something, especially if it's something kind of big where there's a lot of custom components like this one had a lot of, you know, custom SVG components. Those diamonds were a real pain to figure out like all the math.
So it's a lot of trigonometry and stuff. I do find it really nice now to have Observable to just focus on let's figure out how to make this one component. and then let's sort of make the basic visual forms. And then once I get it to the point where I'm like, "Okay, I've checked off the things that I think are kind of tricky, little guess and check things to figure out", then I move it over to a real project.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:20:17]</p>
<p>Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. It's nice to focus in on certain parts and then put them together as opposed to like, "Okay, we're going to start at the top."</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:20:26]</p>
<p>Yeah. It can also be, you know, like a little intimidating, or even just annoying when you're like excited to get right into code, but you have to do all the like setup work to get your project started and the scaffolding and everything. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:20:37]</p>
<p>Yeah.  Is there anything that you think would be really useful for someone who's just getting started with doing data viz? Is there anything that maybe you got really stuck on, that you wish someone had told you?</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:20:53]</p>
<p>I think getting a little bit stuck. So, there's sort of this balance. In the beginning, when you're trying something, it's useful to have rules. And so if you look at books or blog posts and stuff that talk about best practices and data visualization, you know, it'll often give you certain sets of rules.
Nowadays people use things like don't use pie charts, right? And people will spout that, but, I think when you're starting out, it's important to realize that the rules are there for a reason, but the reason is usually to prevent bad usage of something. But it doesn't necessarily mean that a particular thing is always terrible.
So, you know, pie charts are a good example where people say don't use pie charts because they're often misused. But as you level up in data visualization and you get to know more and more, you'll realize that there's plenty of situations in which pie charts are perfectly fine and they might even be the best choice.
But people often carry those rules through as if they were some sort of dogma that, you know, is  always to be obeyed. And so, you know, you see a pie chart and you like start throwing tomatoes at your computer or something. Cause, it's like, "How dare you? You should never use a pie chart!"
So I would say... recognize that rules are useful for giving you guidelines, but that you should always keep an open mind to other ways to visualize things, how things can be used better, or try to think of a better way to do things. So, you know, if people say "Don't use a pie chart", then think about, well, how would I make a pie chart work?
Well, rather than just saying, you know, never use it. Which is sort of what I did with that hurricanes project. I took the idea of like a radial chart, which I said, doesn't really work on the web, or I've never seen one that really worked well on the web. And instead of saying, "Okay, I'm just going to make it a poster" or "I'll just do it in print", I thought, how could I do it that it would work for the web?
Yeah, I love that. It's almost like follow the rules until you understand why they're there, and then break them.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:23:06]</p>
<p>And then the other thing I wanted to ask you about is... wHat makes a good data visualization? I know we just talked about how rules are bad, but are there any rules of thumb that you use when creating new data viz, for deciding whether it's gonna work or not work?</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:23:40]</p>
<p>Yeah, that's a really difficult question because I think it's very specific to the project. So I would say, one thing that I always try to keep in mind is who's the audience for this and what's the purpose of this. For example, if I'm building a chart at Fidelity and you know, the audience for this is a business analyst or maybe one of the like squad managers that works on one of our financial products, and the purpose of the chart is just to communicate to them like how well their product is doing this month, or, you know, which products are underperforming or something. Then I'm going to go for a chart and a style that's optimized for ease of comprehension. You know, I'm going to go with something relatively simple, like a bar chart or a line chart, or some kind of, you know, something that's not too crazy and complicated.
Ahd I'm going to go for a visual style. That's fairly paired back minimalistic that really like focuses on the data and aids the speed of comprehension. On the other hand, if I'm designing something for, you know, journalistic type project for a newspaper where the audience is, maybe a general audience made up of people like, you know, my parents, my friends, like anybody on the street, and you're trying to convince them of something or make something that's going to make an impression on them. Then I might go the opposite direction and go for something that's more artistic. You know, something that is not necessarily going to be super easy to read, but might actually demand that somebody sit down and take some time to invest, to really pick apart, you know, different parts of the visualization.
It might be a totally custom visualization that's not a chart anyone's ever seen before and people might have to sit down and really read through it. The visual design might be more complex, you know, there might be more stylized elements. It might have more emphasis on, you know, colors and typography and layout that are used to evoke a certain feeling or a certain emotion, rather than just visual clarity.
I would say... when you sit down to make something don't always go for, you know, what's the best chart to make this, or, you know, what's the easiest thing to read, but think about who's your audience and then design the chart for them person, or group of people.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:26:19]</p>
<p>I love that so much. That's one of my big things too. And I came from a kind of scientific academic background, like you, and I don't know if you've had this, but I've had to... like when I learned data visualization, I learned like, "Oh, well, our perceptual system is best at, you know, judging whether lines are longer than each other." And then I got thrown into doing like marketing data viz, which...they don't care if you can tell which bar is longer within half a second. Totally different things are going to work for these two different projects.</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:26:55]</p>
<p>Right. And that's a good point actually, is that, you know, a common criticism I'll see sometimes of especially charts that are more out there, like less, you know, less conventional charts is, "Oh, well, this chart isn't very accurate."
You know, you couldn't look at this and tell. What is the number that this symbol represents. But, you know, the truth is that's really, that's usually not the point of a chart. If you want to know what are the exact numbers, just give someone a table, give them a spreadsheet. That's the point of a spreadsheet.
The point of a chart is to give an overall graphical representation so that you can look at it and make comparisons between groups, you know, easily analyze things like relationships between. individuals, get an overall graphical perception, get a sense of scale. You know, those are the things that you use a graph for, not... "What is this exact number?"</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:27:47]</p>
<p>Yup. A hundred percent agree. I think this was so great. I, especially like to your messages of, you know, really know your audience, sketching is very freeing for your ideas, and learning in public. Is there anything else you want to talk about?</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>:
[00:28:11]</p>
<p>Nope, I think that's it. If people like this, they can check out my website. I do post, so that's where I post most of my educational stuff. All my blogs and stuff is on there, and you'll find links to my newsletter, which you can follow, my Twitch, where I do streaming and stuff like that. YEah. And I'm always available. So if people have questions, feel free to reach out, feel free to email me, DM on Twitter.
I'm always happy to help.</p>
<p><strong>Amelia</strong>:
[00:28:39]</p>
<p>Awesome. Thanks so much. Yeah. Thank you.</p>

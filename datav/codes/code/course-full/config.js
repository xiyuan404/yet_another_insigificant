ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Amelia, the author of this course.
I'm a front-end developer at The Pudding

Over the past ten years that I've been visualizing data, I've been perfecting my method and collecting helpful tricks. I'm here to jump-start your own journey!

In Fullstack D3 and Data Visualization, I distill my hard-earned knowledge into bite-sized lessons.

We'll start making charts right away, and learn new concepts and design theory as we go.

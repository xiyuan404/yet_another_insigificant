# Using D3 with Svelte.js

Svelte is a framework for building reactive, component-based user interfaces. It's a great framework for devs new to javascript frameworks, and it leans into reactive coding - your variables will update when their dependencies do!

While the codebase looks very different to the React codebase, the chart library structure is largely the same.

  style={{width: '100%', height: '35em'}}
/>

If you're not interested in developing Svelte applications, I'd recommend poking around and noticing how similar the code is to the React code. If you are interested in developing d3 + Svelte apps, the best route would be:

1. Run through the previous lessons with the React code
2. Try to fill out the `/src/Timeline.svelte` component (including the nested chart, line, & axis components), following our steps
3. Check out the completed code in `/src/completed` after, or if you get stuck. You can switch these out if you change the imports in `src/App.svelte`

```javascript
// import Timeline from "./Timeline.svelte";
// import ScatterPlot from "./ScatterPlot.svelte";
// import Histogram from "./Histogram.svelte";
import Timeline from "./completed/Timeline.svelte";
import ScatterPlot from "./completed/ScatterPlot.svelte";
import Histogram from "./completed/Histogram.svelte";
```
